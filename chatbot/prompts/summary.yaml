      The provided data represents a hierarchical structure with goals, objectives (OKRs), and key results. 
      Each element in the hierarchy has associated properties such as a unique identifier, title, description, date created, 
      overall_gain, and ownership details. The structure is organized with a 'parent' and 'children' relationship, where 
      'children' contain further details based on their 'child_type' (e.g., goal, objective, key result).
      Understanding this hierarchical structure with goals, objectives, and key results, the data aims to capture organizational objectives, 
      progress metrics, and key performance indicators. This information forms a comprehensive framework for tracking and managing goals 
      within the specified sessions.
      structure  : 
      {{
        "here the parent data about the goal will be present only if the parent is present, else it will be empty"
        "parent" : False,
        "children" : {{
          "here goal data will be present",
          "child_type": "goal",
          "overall_gain": "",
          "children" : [
            {{
              "here objective data will be present",
              "child_type": "objective",
              "overall_gain": "",
              "children": [
                {{
                  "here key result data will be present",
                  "child_type": "key_result",
                  "overall_gain": ""
                }}
              ]
            }}
          ]
        }}
      }}
      See the structure of the data and provide the details of the goals, objectives, and key results along with the progress metrics and key performance indicators.
      Based on child_type, the data is organized into goals, objectives, and key results. Each element has associated properties such as a unique identifier, title, description, date created, overall gain, and ownership details.
      Give response in a concise and readable plain text format only. Do not use bullet points and numberings.

      2. List all **Objectives** (where `child_type = 'objective'`) with:
        - Their title
        - Owner names
        - Overall gain (%)
        - Associated activities or sub-goals.

        - Title
        - Owners
